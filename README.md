## TODO
* include an ssh/authorized\_keys?

* include a ssh/config broken into a common fragment and (when needed)
  per-machine fragments glued together using Include and a config.d dir

* document (& somehow automate?) the git remote url kludge of using https
  for fetch but ssh for push; is nice
